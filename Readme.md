## Introduction

Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications without managing infrastructure. This repository is aimed at helping developers understand and utilize serverless services offered by Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). You'll find examples, best practices, and tutorials for leveraging these cloud services effectively.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

- `Google_Cloud/`: Contains resources for Google Cloud Platform.
- `AWS/`: Contains resources for Amazon Web Services.

Each folder includes subfolders and files dedicated to specific serverless services.

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

### Google App Engine (GAE)

Google App Engine is a fully managed serverless platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale. It supports several programming languages and provides automatic scaling.
